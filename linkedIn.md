# 🚀 Introducing: Java Resumes — AI-Powered Resume Generation

Excited to share a project I've been working on!

**Java Resumes** is a full-stack application that transforms structured professional data into polished, AI-enhanced resumes. Built with **Java 21**, **React**, and **LLMs** (Ollama or OpenAI), it solves a real problem: resume writing is tedious, repetitive, and inconsistent.

---

## 💡 The Problem It Solves

✖️ Manual resume creation is time-consuming
✖️ Inconsistent formatting and messaging across variations
✖️ Difficult to tailor resumes for different positions
✖️ No easy way to iterate on professional copy

---

## ✨ How It Works

**1. Structured Input** → Your experience, skills, and background
**2. LLM Processing** → AI generates polished, professional content
**3. Modern UI** → React frontend for easy editing and previewing
**4. Multiple Exports** → PDF, Markdown, or custom formats

The best part? You control everything:

- Run **locally** with Ollama for complete privacy
- Use **OpenAI** for cloud-scale capabilities
- Iterate **instantly** with real-time previews

**⚠️ Important:** All AI-generated content should be carefully reviewed for accuracy. LLMs can hallucinate or make errors. File generation may take several minutes to complete, depending on model size and complexity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java 21 with clean, modular architecture
- **Frontend:** ReactJS with responsive, intuitive UI
- **AI:** Ollama (local) or OpenAI (cloud)
- **Build:** Gradle + Node for seamless workflow

## 🎯 Who Should Care?

✅ Developers exploring LLM integration in Java
✅ Job seekers wanting consistent, high-quality resumes
✅ Teams building HR or talent-management tools
✅ Anyone interested in practical AI workflows
