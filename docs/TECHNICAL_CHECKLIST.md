## 🧪 Manual Testing Checklist (For User)

### Add Model

- [ ] Click "Add Model" button
- [ ] Dialog appears with label and value fields
- [ ] Enter label: "Test Model"
- [ ] Enter value: "test-model-123"
- [ ] Click Add button
- [ ] Model appears in table
- [ ] Model appears in DocumentUploadForm dropdown
- [ ] Close and reopen browser
- [ ] Model still exists (persistence verified)

### Delete Model

- [ ] Click delete icon on a model
- [ ] Model removed from table
- [ ] Model removed from dropdown
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Model still gone (deletion saved)

### Export

- [ ] Click "Export Models" button
- [ ] JSON file downloads
- [ ] Open file in text editor
- [ ] Verify JSON format is valid
- [ ] Contains all current models
- [ ] Can be shared with others

### Import

- [ ] Export current models as backup
- [ ] Delete or add some models
- [ ] Click "Import Models" button
- [ ] Select previously exported file
- [ ] Wait for import to complete
- [ ] Models match exported list

### Reset

- [ ] Make some model changes (add/delete)
- [ ] Click "Reset to Defaults" button
- [ ] Confirm action
- [ ] Models return to DEFAULT_MODELS
- [ ] Previous changes gone

### Persistence

- [ ] Add a custom model
- [ ] Close browser completely
