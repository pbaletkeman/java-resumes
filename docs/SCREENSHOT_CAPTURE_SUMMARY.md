## ⚠️ Failures & Root Causes

### Failed Captures

**1. Frontend: main-tab.png**

- **Error**: `Execution context was destroyed, most likely because of a navigation`
- **Cause**: Browser navigation timeout (frontend dev server not responding quickly enough on initial load)
- **Resolution**: Frontend dev server may need to be running, or the wait timeout needs to be increased

**2. Frontend: file-history.png**

- **Error**: `Execution context was destroyed, most likely because of a navigation`
- **Cause**: Same as above - context destroyed during navigation
- **Resolution**: Same as above

### Browser Context Issues

During extended test runs, Playwright browser instances were terminated due to:

- Long navigation waits (frontend server delays)
- Timeout of 10 seconds exceeded for some pages
- Browser memory management during sequential captures

**Mitigation**: The script included timeout handling and partial load tolerance, allowing it to continue with remaining screenshots despite individual failures.

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Script Configuration

- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js with ES modules)
- **Framework**: Playwright @1.57.0
- **Browser**: Chromium (headless mode)
- **Viewport Sizes**:
  - Standard desktop: 800x600px, 1000x600px, 1200x800px
  - Mobile: 375x812px (iPhone)

### Execution Time

- Total execution time: ~30-45 seconds
- Average per screenshot: ~2-3 seconds
- Browser startup: ~5-10 seconds
- Browser shutdown: ~2 seconds

### Environment

- **OS**: Windows 10
- **Node.js**: v23.3.0
- **Playwright**: @1.57.0
- **Working Directory**: `frontend/`
- **Output Base**: Repository root `docs/screenshots/`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Retry Failed Screenshots

To capture the 2 missing frontend screenshots (`main-tab.png` and `file-history.png`):

1. Ensure frontend dev server is running on `http://localhost:3001`
2. Run the script again with extended timeouts:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   node capture-screenshots.mjs
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Screenshot Capture

If the script continues to fail for specific pages:

1. Open each URL in a web browser manually
2. Use browser developer tools or screenshot tools to capture
3. Save with the expected filenames to `docs/screenshots/[category]/`

### Option 3: Script Enhancement

To improve reliability:

1. Increase navigation timeout from 10000ms to 15000ms or more
2. Add retry logic for failed captures
3. Add specific wait conditions before taking screenshots (wait for specific elements to be visible)
4. Use the `waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded')` instead of `'networkidle'`

## 📝 Notes & Observations

1. **Backend API Screenshots**: Most successful category (100% capture rate). Swagger UI loaded consistently and reliably.

2. **Architecture & Setup**: All screenshots captured successfully. These primarily show the frontend UI and loaded without issues.

3. **Frontend Challenges**: Two frontend screenshots failed due to navigation timeouts. The frontend dev server may need to be pre-started and fully loaded before script execution.

4. **Mobile View**: Successfully captured responsive layout at iPhone dimensions (375x812px), useful for mobile documentation.

5. **Theme Capture**: Both light and dark themes were successfully captured, demonstrating UI theme variations.
