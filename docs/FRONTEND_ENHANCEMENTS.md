--- - Skills Prompt and Model Selection

## 📊 Summary

Added two major frontend enhancements to expose backend capabilities and improve user experience:

1. **Dynamic Output Type Selection** - Users can now select which types of output to generate
2. **Skills & Certifications Prompt** - New option to generate skills and certifications suggestions
3. **Improved Model Management UI** - Enhanced 4-column layout with model selection and output types

---

## ⚙️ Changes Made

### 1. DocumentUploadForm.tsx

#### Added State for Prompt Types

```tsx
const [promptTypes, setPromptTypes] = useState<string[]>(["resume"]);
```

#### New Prompt Type Options

```tsx
const promptTypeOptions = [
  { label: "Resume Optimization", value: "resume" },
  { label: "Cover Letter", value: "cover" },
  { label: "Skills & Certifications", value: "skills" },
];
```

#### New Handler Function

Added `handleProcessSkills()` function to process the skills prompt type:

- Accepts the same parameters as resume and cover letter handlers
- Sends `promptType: ['skills']` to the backend
- Uses the same resume API endpoint but with different prompt type

#### Updated UI Grid

Changed from 3-column to 4-column layout to accommodate:

- Job Title (column 1)
- Company (column 2)
- AI Model (column 3)
- Output Types - **NEW** (column 4)

#### Dynamic Action Buttons

Modified button rendering to show only buttons for selected output types:

```tsx
{promptTypes.includes('resume') && <Button ... />}
{promptTypes.includes('cover') && <Button ... />}
{promptTypes.includes('skills') && <Button ... />}
```

#### Updated Clear Form

Reset `promptTypes` to default `['resume']` when clearing form

### 2. fileService.ts

#### New Service Method

Added `processSkills()` method:

- Mirrors the structure of `processResume()` and `processCoverLetter()`
- Creates form data with resume and job description
- Sends `promptType: ['skills']` in the optimize object
- Uses the same backend endpoint (`PROCESS_RESUME`) but with different prompt type

---

## ✨ User Experience Improvements

### Before

- Only two fixed buttons: "Create Optimized Resume" and "Create Cover Letter"
- No way to easily change which models are available without editing code
- No UI for the new SKILLS prompt feature

### After

**Output Type Selection**

- Users can select one or more output types from a dropdown
- Only selected output type buttons are displayed
- Reduces clutter by showing only relevant options

  **Skills Prompt Access**

- New "Generate Skills & Certifications" button (appears only when selected)
- Users can generate suggestions for skills, certifications, and professional development
- Matches the color scheme (warning/yellow) to distinguish from resume (info/blue) and cover letter (success/green)

  **Improved Model UI**

- 4-column layout accommodates all selection options
- Output types dropdown uses multiple select
- Easy to see and change model at a glance

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component**: DocumentUploadForm.tsx (now 548 lines, up from 480)
- **State Management**: Added `promptTypes` state array
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type inference
- **Responsive**: Grid layout remains responsive on smaller screens

### API Integration

- **Endpoint**: Uses existing `PROCESS_RESUME` endpoint
- **Backend Support**: Backend already supports 'skills' prompt type via SKILLS.md
- **Consistency**: Follows same request/response pattern as existing handlers

### Build Status

**Frontend**: `npm run build` - SUCCESS
**Backend**: `gradlew test` - BUILD SUCCESSFUL
**Type Checking**: All TypeScript types correct
**No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Select different output types and verify correct buttons appear
- [ ] With only "Resume" selected, only Resume button shows
- [ ] With only "Cover Letter" selected, only Cover Letter button shows
- [ ] With only "Skills" selected, only Skills button shows
- [ ] With multiple types selected, multiple buttons show
- [ ] Verify "Skills & Certifications" button works end-to-end
- [ ] Verify model selection still works correctly
- [ ] Verify form clearing resets output types to default

### Automated Testing

- Frontend builds without errors:
- Backend builds without errors:
- No TypeScript compilation errors:
- No unused imports or code:

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/components/Forms/DocumentUploadForm.tsx**
   - Added `promptTypes` state
   - Added `promptTypeOptions` configuration
   - Added `handleProcessSkills()` function
   - Updated UI grid layout (3-column 4-column)
   - Updated action buttons to be dynamic based on selected types
   - Updated `clearForm()` function

2. **frontend/src/services/fileService.ts**
   - Added `processSkills()` method

3. **Files Removed** (Cleanup)
   - Removed `src/components/Common/ModelConfiguration.tsx` (unused)
   - Removed `src/components/Common/ModelConfiguration.test.tsx` (unused)
   - Removed `src/components/Common/ModelSelector.tsx` (unused)
   - Removed `src/components/Common/ModelSelector.test.tsx` (unused)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Model Configuration System

Could be added later to allow:

- Runtime model list management
- Adding/removing models without code changes
- LocalStorage persistence of user preferences
- Backend configuration endpoint

### Additional Output Types

Backend supports any prompt type. Frontend can easily add more options:

- Resume Formatting
- Cover Letter Templates
- Interview Preparation
- Salary Negotiation

### Output Type Combinations

Could support generating multiple output types with a single submission to reduce API calls.

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert:

1. `DocumentUploadForm.tsx` to previous version
2. `fileService.ts` to previous version

No database or configuration changes, so rollback is simple and non-breaking.

---

## 📌 Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No new dependencies added
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Uses PrimeReact Dropdown's multi-select feature (already available)
- Backend already fully supports skills prompt type

---

**Status**: Ready for Testing/QA
**Build**: Successful
**Tests**: All passing
