# 🚀 Java Resumes — AI‑Powered Resume Generation with Java 25, React, and LLMs

**Java Resumes** is a full‑stack application that turns structured professional data into polished, AI‑enhanced resumes. It combines a modern Java 25 backend, a ReactJS frontend, and your choice of LLM provider (Ollama or OpenAI) to generate clean, customizable resume content with minimal effort.

This project is designed for developers, job seekers, and teams who want a repeatable, automated way to produce high‑quality resumes without wrestling with templates or formatting.

## ✨ What This Project Does

### 🔧 1. Converts structured data into resume‑ready content

Users provide their experience, skills, and background in a structured format. The backend transforms this into a clean JSON representation that the LLM can refine.

### 🤖 2. Uses an LLM to generate polished, professional text

The system supports both **Ollama** (local models) and **OpenAI** (cloud models).
The LLM takes the structured data and produces:

- Professional summaries
- Experience descriptions
- Skills sections
- Tailored resume variations

This gives users flexibility: run everything locally or tap into cloud‑scale models.

### 🖥️ 3. Provides a modern, responsive ReactJS UI

The frontend makes it easy to:

- Enter or edit resume data
- Trigger AI generation
- Preview the output
- Export or reuse the generated content

It’s clean, fast, and built for iteration.

### ☕ 4. Built on Java 25 with a clean modular architecture

The backend uses modern Java features and a straightforward API design.
It’s easy to extend, integrate, or adapt for:

- Portfolio builders
- Job‑application automation
- HR tooling
- Developer productivity tools

## 🧩 Why This Project Exists

Resume writing is tedious, repetitive, and often inconsistent.
This project solves that by:

- Separating **data** from **presentation**
- Using LLMs to generate high‑quality text
- Making the process repeatable and customizable
- Allowing developers to run everything locally if they prefer privacy

It’s a practical example of how LLMs can enhance everyday workflows without replacing developer control.
